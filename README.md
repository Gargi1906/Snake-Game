# Snake-Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake and navigate it around the screen to eat food and grow in length. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

# Features
1. Snake Movement: The game enables players to control the snake's movement using arrow keys or touch gestures on mobile devices.

2. Food Generation: The game randomly generates food on the screen for the snake to eat and grow in length.

3. Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the snake eats food.

4. Game Over Detection: The game detects when the snake collides with the walls or its own body, ending the game.

5.Replayability: After a game ends, players can choose to start a new game.

# Getting Started

3.The Snake game will start, and you can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys or touch gestures.

# Customization
To customize the Snake game, consider the following options:

1.Grid Size: Modify the grid size by changing the GRID_SIZE constant in the JavaScript file (script.js). You can increase or decrease the size to adjust the gameplay area.

2.Snake Speed: Adjust the snake's speed by changing the SNAKE_SPEED constant in the JavaScript file. Higher values will make the snake move faster.

3.Colors and Styles: Customize the appearance of the game elements by modifying the CSS file (styles.css). Update colors, fonts, and other styles to match your preferences.
